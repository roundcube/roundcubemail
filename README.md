ATTENTION
---------
This is just a snapshot from the GIT repository and is **NOT A STABLE
version of Roundcube**. It's not recommended to replace an existing installation
of Roundcube with this version. Also using a separate database for this
installation is highly recommended.


INTRODUCTION
------------
Roundcube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an
application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect
from an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder management,
message searching and spell checking. Roundcube Webmail is written in PHP and
requires the MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database. With its plugin API it is
easily extendable and the user interface is fully customizable using skins.

The code designed to run on a webserver is mainly written in PHP and Javascript.
It includes a custom framework with an IMAP library derived from [IlohaMail][iloha]
and requires a set of external libraries (see composer.json and jsdeps.json files).


INSTALLATION
------------
For detailed instructions on how to install Roundcube webmail on your server,
please refer to the INSTALL document in the same directory as this document.

If you're updating an older version of Roundcube please follow the steps
described in the UPGRADING file.

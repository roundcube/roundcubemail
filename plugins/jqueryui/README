|  Plugin:  jqueryui
|  Version: 1.12.0
|  Purpose: Add jquery-ui to roundcube for every plugin to use
|
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

jqueryui adds the complete jquery-ui library including the smoothness
theme to roundcube. This allows other plugins to use jquery-ui without
having to load their own version. The benefit of using 1 central jquery-ui
is that we wont run into problems of conflicting jquery libraries being
loaded. All plugins that want to use jquery-ui should use this plugin as
a requirement.

It is possible for plugin authors to override the default smoothness theme.
To do this, go to the jquery-ui website, and use the download feature to
download your own theme. In the advanced settings, provide a scope class to
your theme and add that class to all your UI elements. Finally, load the
downloaded css files in your own plugin.

Some jquery-ui modules provide localization. One example is the datepicker module.
If you want to load localization for a specific module, then set up config.inc.php.
Check the config.inc.php.dist file on how to set this up for the datepicker module.

As of version 1.8.6 this plugin also supports other themes. If you're a theme
developer and would like a different default theme to be used for your RC theme
then let me know and we can set things up.

This also provides some common UI modules e.g. miniColors extension.

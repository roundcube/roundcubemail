    Sharing Calendars
    =================

    For collaboration, sharing calendars is an important feature. In the :ref:`overview <calendar-lists>`,
    we have already learned how calendars others share with you appear in the calendars list. The following
    now explains how to make personal calendars accessible to fellow users.


    Share a Calendar with others
    ----------------------------

    Sharing is controlled through the :ref:`Calendar Settings Dialog <calendar-edit-properties>`.
    Double-click a calendar in the list on the left and then select the *Sharing* tab at the top of
    the dialog box:

    The table displays who already has permission to see and modify the selected calendar.
    In order to share the calendar with a new user do

    1. Click the *Add entry* button (+) in the table footer
    2. Enter the username or choose one from the autocompletion menu that appears when you start typing.
       Instead of a specific user, permissons can be granted for all users or guests.
    3. Select the access rights you want to grant for the user
    4. Click *Save* to add the permission

    Double-click an entry to edit the permissions for a particular user or group.

    For removing existing permissions, select the according entry in the list and then choose
    *Delete* from the menu behind the gear icon in the footer of the list.


    Subscribe to Shared Calendars
    -----------------------------

    Calendars shared by others are not showing up right away in the list within the calendar view.
    Switch to :ref:`Settings > Folders <settings-folders>` to see all resources you can access.
    There's a shortcut to this: click *Manage folders* in the options menu behind the gear icon
    located the footer of the calendars list.

    In order to make a shared calendar appear in the calendars list, locate it in the folder manager
    and check the *Subscribed* mark in the list. Only subscribed calendars are visible in the calendar view.

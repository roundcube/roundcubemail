/**
 * expect driver
 *
 * Driver that adds functionality to change the systems user password via
 * the 'expect' command.
 *
 * For installation instructions please read the README file.
 *
 * @version 2.0
 * @author Andy Theuninck <gohanman@gmail.com)
 *
 * Based on chpasswd roundcubemail password driver by
 * @author Alex Cartwright <acartwright@mutinydesign.co.uk)
 * and expect horde passwd driver by
 * @author  Gaudenz Steinlin <gaudenz@soziologie.ch>
 *
 * Configuration settings:
 * password_expect_bin => location of expect (e.g. /usr/bin/expect)
 * password_expect_script => path to "password-expect" file
 * password_expect_params => arguments for the expect script
 *   see the password-expect file for details. This is probably
 *   a good starting default:
 *   -telent -host localhost -output /tmp/passwd.log -log /tmp/passwd.log

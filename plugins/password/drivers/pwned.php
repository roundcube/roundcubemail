/**
 * Have I Been Pwned Password Strength Driver
 *
 * Driver to check passwords using HIBP:
 * https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords
 *
 * This driver will return a strength of:
 *     3: if the password WAS NOT found in HIBP
 *     1: if the password WAS found in HIBP
 *     2: if there was an ERROR retrieving data.
 *
 * To use this driver, configure (in ../config.inc.php):
 *
 * $config['password_strength_driver'] = 'pwned';
 * $config['password_minimum_score'] = 3;
 *
 * Set the minimum score to 3 if you want to make sure that all
 * passwords are successfully checked against HIBP (recommended).
 *
 * Set it to 2 if you still want to accept passwords in case a
 * HIBP check fails for some (technical) reason.
 *
 * Setting the minimum score to 1 or less effectively renders
 * the checks useless, as all passwords would be accepted.
 * Setting it to 4 or more will effectively reject all passwords.
 *
 * This driver will only return a maximum score of 3 because not
 * being listed in HIBP does not necessarily mean that the
 * password is a good one. It is therefore recommended to also
 * configure a minimum length for the password.
 *

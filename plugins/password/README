 1. Configuration
 ----------------

 Copy config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php and set the options as described
 within the file.


 2. Drivers
 ----------

 Password plugin supports many password change mechanisms which are
 handled by included drivers. Just pass driver name in 'password_driver' option.


 2.1. Database (sql)
 -------------------

 You can specify which database to connect by 'password_db_dsn' option and
 what SQL query to execute by 'password_query'. See config.inc.php.dist file for
 more info.

 Example implementations of an update_passwd function:

 - This is for use with LMS (http://lms.org.pl) database and postgres:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_passwd(hash text, account text) RETURNS integer AS $$
    DECLARE
            res integer;
    BEGIN
        UPDATE passwd SET password = hash
        WHERE login = split_part(account, '@', 1)
            AND domainid = (SELECT id FROM domains WHERE name = split_part(account, '@', 2))
        RETURNING id INTO res;
        RETURN res;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

 - This is for use with a SELECT update_passwd(%o,%c,%u) query
   Updates the password only when the old password matches the MD5 password
   in the database

    CREATE FUNCTION update_password (oldpass text, cryptpass text, user text) RETURNS text
        MODIFIES SQL DATA
    BEGIN
        DECLARE currentsalt varchar(20);
        DECLARE error text;
        SET error = 'incorrect current password';
        SELECT substring_index(substr(user.password,4),_latin1'$',1) INTO currentsalt FROM users WHERE username=user;
        SELECT '' INTO error FROM users WHERE username=user AND password=ENCRYPT(oldpass,currentsalt);
        UPDATE users SET password=cryptpass WHERE username=user AND password=ENCRYPT(oldpass,currentsalt);
        RETURN error;
    END

 Example SQL UPDATEs:

 - Plain text passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=%p WHERE username=%u AND password=%o AND domain=%h LIMIT 1

 - Crypt text passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=%c WHERE username=%u LIMIT 1

 - Use a MYSQL crypt function (*nix only) with random 8 character salt
    UPDATE users SET password=ENCRYPT(%p,concat(_utf8'$1$',right(md5(rand()),8),_utf8'$')) WHERE username=%u LIMIT 1

 - MD5 stored passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=MD5(%p) WHERE username=%u AND password=MD5(%o) LIMIT 1


 2.2. Cyrus/SASL (sasl)
 ----------------------

 Cyrus SASL database authentication allows your Cyrus+Roundcube
 installation to host mail users without requiring a Unix Shell account!

 This driver only covers the "sasldb" case when using Cyrus SASL. Kerberos
 and PAM authentication mechanisms will require other techniques to enable
 user password manipulations.

 Cyrus SASL includes a shell utility called "saslpasswd" for manipulating
 user passwords in the "sasldb" database.  This plugin attempts to use
 this utility to perform password manipulations required by your webmail
 users without any administrative interaction. Unfortunately, this
 scheme requires that the "saslpasswd" utility be run as the "cyrus"
 user - kind of a security problem since we have chosen to SUID a small
 script which will allow this to happen.

 This driver is based on the Squirrelmail Change SASL Password Plugin.
 See http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=107 for details.

 Installation:

 Change into the helpers directory. Edit the chgsaslpasswd.c file as is
 documented within it.

 Compile the wrapper program:
    gcc -o chgsaslpasswd chgsaslpasswd.c

 Chown the compiled chgsaslpasswd binary to the cyrus user and group
 that your browser runs as, then chmod them to 4550.

 For example, if your cyrus user is 'cyrus' and the apache server group is
 'nobody' (I've been told Redhat runs Apache as user 'apache'):

    chown cyrus:nobody chgsaslpasswd
    chmod 4550 chgsaslpasswd

 Stephen Carr has suggested users should try to run the scripts on a test
 account as the cyrus user eg;

    su cyrus -c "./chgsaslpasswd -p test_account"

 This will allow you to make sure that the script will work for your setup.
 Should the script not work, make sure that:
 1) the user the script runs as has access to the saslpasswd|saslpasswd2
   file and proper permissions
 2) make sure the user in the chgsaslpasswd.c file is set correctly.
   This could save you some headaches if you are the paranoid type.


 2.3. Poppassd/Courierpassd (poppassd)
 -------------------------------------

 You can specify which host to connect to via 'password_pop_host' and
 what port via 'password_pop_port'. See config.inc.php.dist file for more info.


 2.4. LDAP (ldap)
 ----------------

 See config.inc.php.dist file. Requires PEAR::Net_LDAP2 package.


 2.5. DirectAdmin Control Panel (directadmin)
 --------------------------------------------

 You can specify which host to connect to via 'password_directadmin_host' (don't 
 forget to use tcp:// or ssl://) and what port via 'password_direactadmin_port'.
 The password enforcement with plenty customization can be done directly by 
 DirectAdmin, please see http://www.directadmin.com/features.php?id=910
 See config.inc.php.dist file for more info.


 2.6. cPanel (cpanel)
 --------------------

 Install cPanel XMLAPI Client Class into Roundcube program/lib directory
 or any other place in PHP include path. You can get the class from
 https://raw.github.com/CpanelInc/xmlapi-php/master/xmlapi.php

 You can configure parameters for connection to cPanel's API interface.
 See config.inc.php.dist file for more info.


 2.7. XIMSS/Communigate (ximms)
 ------------------------------

 You can specify which host and port to connect to via 'password_ximss_host' 
 and 'password_ximss_port'. See config.inc.php.dist file for more info.


 2.8. Virtualmin (virtualmin)
 ----------------------------

 As in sasl driver this one allows to change password using shell
 utility called "virtualmin". See helpers/chgvirtualminpasswd.c for
 installation instructions. See also config.inc.php.dist file.


 2.9. hMailServer (hmail)
 ------------------------

 Requires PHP COM (Windows only). For access to hMail server on remote host
 you'll need to define 'hmailserver_remote_dcom' and 'hmailserver_server'.
 See config.inc.php.dist file for more info.


 2.10. PAM (pam)
 ---------------

 This driver is for changing passwords of shell users authenticated with PAM.
 Requires PECL's PAM exitension to be installed (http://pecl.php.net/package/PAM).


 2.11. Chpasswd (chpasswd)
 -------------------------

 Driver that adds functionality to change the systems user password via 
 the 'chpasswd' command. See config.inc.php.dist file.

 Attached wrapper script (helpers/chpass-wrapper.py) restricts password changes
 to uids >= 1000 and can deny requests based on a blacklist.


 2.12.  LDAP - no PEAR (ldap_simple)
 -----------------------------------

 It's rewritten ldap driver that doesn't require the Net_LDAP2 PEAR extension.
 It uses directly PHP's ldap module functions instead (as Roundcube does).

 This driver is fully compatible with the ldap driver, but
 does not require (or uses) the
    $config['password_ldap_force_replace'] variable.
 Other advantages:
    * Connects only once with the LDAP server when using the search user.
    * Does not read the DN, but only replaces the password within (that is
      why the 'force replace' is always used).


 2.13.  XMail (xmail)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver for XMail (www.xmailserver.org). See config.inc.php.dist file
 for configuration description.


 2.14.  Pw (pw_usermod)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver to change the systems user password via the 'pw usermod' command.
 See config.inc.php.dist file for configuration description.


 2.15.  domainFACTORY (domainfactory)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver for the hosting provider domainFACTORY (www.df.eu).
 No configuration options.


 2.16.  DBMail (dbmail)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver that adds functionality to change the users DBMail password.
 It only works with dbmail-users on the same host where Roundcube runs
 and requires shell access and gcc in order to compile the binary
 (see instructions in chgdbmailusers.c file).
 See config.inc.php.dist file for configuration description.

 Note: DBMail users can also use sql driver.


 2.17.  Expect (expect)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver to change user password via the 'expect' command.
 See config.inc.php.dist file for configuration description.


 2.18.  Samba (smb)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver to change Samba user password via the 'smbpasswd' command.
 See config.inc.php.dist file for configuration description.

 2.19. Vpopmail daemon (vpopmaild)
 -----------------------------------

 Driver for the daemon of vpopmail. Vpopmail is used with qmail to
 enable virtual users that are saved in a database and not in /etc/passwd.

 Set $config['password_vpopmaild_host'] to the host where vpopmaild runs.

 Set $config['password_vpopmaild_port'] to the port of vpopmaild.


 3. Driver API
 -------------

 Driver file (<driver_name>.php) must define 'password_save' function with
 two arguments. First - current password, second - new password. Function
 should return PASSWORD_SUCCESS on success or any of PASSWORD_CONNECT_ERROR,
 PASSWORD_CRYPT_ERROR, PASSWORD_ERROR when driver was unable to change password.
 Extended result (as a hash-array with 'message' and 'code' items) can be returned
 too. See existing drivers in drivers/ directory for examples.

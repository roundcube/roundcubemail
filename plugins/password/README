 1. Configuration
 ----------------

 * See config.inc.php file.


 2. Drivers
 ----------

 Password plugin supports many password change mechanisms which are
 handled by included drivers. Just pass driver name in 'password_driver' option.


 2.1. Database (sql)
 -------------------

 You can specify which database to connect by 'password_db_dsn' option and
 what SQL query to execute by 'password_query'. See main.inc.php file for
 more info.
    
 Example implementations of an update_passwd function:

 - This is for use with LMS (http://lms.org.pl) database and postgres:

	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_passwd(hash text, account text) RETURNS integer AS $$
	DECLARE
    	    res integer;
	BEGIN
    	    UPDATE passwd SET password = hash
	    WHERE login = split_part(account, '@', 1)
		AND domainid = (SELECT id FROM domains WHERE name = split_part(account, '@', 2))
	    RETURNING id INTO res;
	    RETURN res;
	END;
	$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

 - This is for use with a SELECT update_passwd(%o,%c,%u) query
	Updates the password only when the old password matches the MD5 password
	in the database

	CREATE FUNCTION update_password (oldpass text, cryptpass text, user text) RETURNS text
    	    MODIFIES SQL DATA
	BEGIN
	    DECLARE currentsalt varchar(20);
	    DECLARE error text;
	    SET error = 'incorrect current password';
	    SELECT substring_index(substr(user.password,4),_latin1'$',1) INTO currentsalt FROM users WHERE username=user;
	    SELECT '' INTO error FROM users WHERE username=user AND password=ENCRYPT(oldpass,currentsalt);
	    UPDATE users SET password=cryptpass WHERE username=user AND password=ENCRYPT(oldpass,currentsalt);
	    RETURN error;
	END

 Example SQL UPDATEs:
 
 - Plain text passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=%p WHERE username=%u AND password=%o AND domain=%h LIMIT 1
 
 - Crypt text passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=%c WHERE username=%u LIMIT 1

 - Use a MYSQL crypt function (*nix only) with random 8 character salt
    UPDATE users SET password=ENCRYPT(%p,concat(_utf8'$1$',right(md5(rand()),8),_utf8'$')) WHERE username=%u LIMIT 1
 
 - MD5 stored passwords:
    UPDATE users SET password=MD5(%p) WHERE username=%u AND password=MD5(%o) LIMIT 1


 2.2. Cyrus/SASL (sasl)
 ----------------------

 Cyrus SASL database authentication allows your Cyrus+RoundCube
 installation to host mail users without requiring a Unix Shell account!

 This driver only covers the "sasldb" case when using Cyrus SASL. Kerberos
 and PAM authentication mechanisms will require other techniques to enable
 user password manipulations.

 Cyrus SASL includes a shell utility called "saslpasswd" for manipulating
 user passwords in the "sasldb" database.  This plugin attempts to use
 this utility to perform password manipulations required by your webmail
 users without any administrative interaction. Unfortunately, this
 scheme requires that the "saslpasswd" utility be run as the "cyrus"
 user - kind of a security problem since we have chosen to SUID a small
 script which will allow this to happen.

 This driver is based on the Squirrelmail Change SASL Password Plugin.
 See http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=107 for details.

 Installation:

 Edit the chgsaslpasswd.c and chgsaslpasswd.sh files as is documented
 within them.

 Compile the wrapper program:
	gcc -o chgsaslpasswd chgsaslpasswd.c

 Chown the chgsaslpasswd and chgsaslpasswd.sh to the cyrus user and group 
 that your browser runs as, then chmod them to 4550.

 For example, if your cyrus user is 'cyrus' and the apache server group is
 'nobody' (I've been told Redhat runs Apache as user 'apache'):

	chown cyrus:nobody chgsaslpasswd
	chmod 4550 chgsaslpasswd

 Stephen Carr has suggested users should try to run the scripts on a test
 account as the cyrus user eg;

	su cyrus -c "./chgsaslpasswd -p test_account"

 This will allow you to make sure that the script will work for your setup.
 Should the script not work, make sure that:
 1) the user the script runs as has access to the saslpasswd|saslpasswd2
   file and proper permissions
 2) make sure the user in the chgsaslpasswd.c file is set correctly.
   This could save you some headaches if you are the paranoid type.


 3. Driver API
 -------------
 
 Driver file (<driver_name>.php) must define 'password_save' function with
 two arguments. First - current password, second - new password. Function
 may return PASSWORD_SUCCESS on success or PASSWORD_ERROR on any error.
 See existing drivers in drivers/ directory for examples.

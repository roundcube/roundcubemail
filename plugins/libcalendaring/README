Library providing common functions for calendar-based plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------

Provides utility functions for calendar-related modules such as

* alarms display and dismissal
* attachment handling
* iCal parsing and exporting

iCal parsing and exporting is done with the help of the Sabretooth VObject
library [1]. A copy of that library with all its dependencies is part of this
package. In order to update it, execute ./get_sabre_vobject.sh within the
lib/ directory.

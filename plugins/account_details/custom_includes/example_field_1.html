	Here is an example file to be put directly into a field
	in the serverinfo box. Note that there are some padding
	on the cell, because we want them to look nice with plain
	text only. If you want to add block elements, experiment
	with the margin and paddings on the top and bottom object,
	to make things look perfect.

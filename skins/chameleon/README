PACKAGING and INSTALLATION
--------------------------

styles.css is written using LESS syntax. Thus it needs to be compiled
using the `lessc` command line tool. This comes with the `nodejs-less`
RPM package which depends on nodejs.

 $ lessc -x skins/chameleon/styles.less > destination-directory/styles.css

(the -x option minifies the CSS code)

References to image files from the included CSS files can be appended
with cache-buster marks to avoid browser caching issues after updating.

Run `bin/updatecss.sh --dir <path-to-kolab-skin>` from the Roundcube
package before packaging the skin or after installing it on the
destination system.

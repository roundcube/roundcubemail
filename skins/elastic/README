PROJECT GOALS
-------------
Create a user interface that is clean and usable with any screen size.
Use new technologies like e.g. flexbox, @media, font-icons or less.
Cleanup css/html and unify as much as possible.


INSTALLATION (development):
---------------------------
1. git clone https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail.git --branch dev-elastic
2. cd roundcubemail/skins
3. git clone https://github.com/roundcube/elastic.git
4. Disable all plugins (we're not there yet) and set devel_mode=true.

INSTALLATION (production):
--------------------------
All styles are written using LESS syntax. Thus it needs to be compiled
using the `lessc` command line tool. This comes with the `nodejs-less`
RPM package which depends on nodejs.

 $ lessc -x styles/styles.less > styles/styles.css
 $ lessc -x styles/print.less > styles/print.css

(the -x option minifies the CSS code)

References to image files from the included CSS files can be appended
with cache-buster marks to avoid browser caching issues after updating.

Run `bin/updatecss.sh --dir <path-to-kolab-skin>` from the Roundcube
package before packaging the skin or after installing it on the
destination system.

- Every button, that is not <button> nor <input> should have inner <span class="inner"> element
  for the button label.

Social guidelines for working on Roundcubemail
==============================================

These are some practical rules derived from the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) regarding how we work on all Roundcube projects:

* Be kind and polite. The tone of a conversation influences its outcome, and also the tone of the next conversation. Even people writing rudely sometime calm down if they get a polite response, and if not, other people read our statements, too, and adjust their tone.
* Always thank others for their work. They used their time and energy to contribute something, which is great already!
* Keep descriptions comprehensible and accurate. Tending to written statements expresses respect for all our time and helps to avoid misinterpretation.
* Explain yourself. Text-only communication can often come across as rude since there is no facial expression and tone of voice, so do the extra step and write longer sentences.
* Use (your own) pull requests. Don't push to other people's or mutually used branches. You might break something, or create unexpected code conflicts for others. Pull requests can be opened targetting other people's branches, too.
* Ask others politely to follow these rules, if they don't. We all a human and make errors, we all can learn.

Sometimes a quick, informal exchange can help to avoid confusion or anger. The ["Background chat" channel](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/call/1280760291) is available for that purpose.

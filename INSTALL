INTRODUCTION
============

This file describes the basic steps to install Roundcube Webmail on your
web server. For additional information, please also consult the project's
wiki page at http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki


REQUIREMENTS
============

* The Apache or Lighttpd Webserver

   - MDB2 2.5.0 or newer
   - Mail_Mime 1.8.1 or newer
   - Net_SMTP 1.4.2 or newer
   - Auth_SASL 1.0.3 or newer
* php.ini options (see .htaccess file):
   - error_reporting E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE (or lower)
   - memory_limit > 16MB (increase as suitable to support large attachments)
   - file_uploads enabled (for attachment upload features)
   - session.auto_start disabled
   - zend.ze1_compatibility_mode disabled
   - suhosin.session.encrypt disabled
   - mbstring.func_overload disabled
* PHP compiled with OpenSSL to connect to IMAPS and to use the spell checker
* A MySQL (4.0.8 or newer), PostgreSQL, MSSQL database engine
  or the SQLite extension for PHP
* One of the above databases with permission to create tables
* An SMTP server (recommended) or PHP configured for mail delivery


INSTALLATION
============

1. Decompress and put this folder somewhere inside your document root
2. Make sure that the following directories (and the files within)
   are writable by the webserver
   - /temp
   - /logs
3. Create a new database and a database user for Roundcube (see DATABASE SETUP)
4. Point your browser to http://url-to-roundcube/installer/
5. Follow the instructions of the install script (or see MANUAL CONFIGURATION)
6. After creating and testing the configuration, remove the installer directory
7. Done!


CONFIGURATION HINTS
===================

Roundcube writes internal errors to the 'errors' log file located in the logs
directory which can be configured in config/main.inc.php. If you want ordinary
PHP errors to be logged there as well, enable the 'php_value error_log' line
in the .htaccess file and set the path to the log file accordingly.

By default the session_path settings of PHP are not modified by Roundcube.
However if you want to limit the session cookies to the directory where
Roundcube resides you can uncomment and configure the according line
in the .htaccess file.


DATABASE SETUP
==============

Note: Database for Roundcube must use UTF-8 character set.

* MySQL
-------
Setting up the mysql database can be done by creating an empty database,
importing the table layout and granting the proper permissions to the
roundcube user. Here is an example of that procedure:

# mysql
> CREATE DATABASE roundcubemail /*!40101 CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci */;
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON roundcubemail.* TO roundcube@localhost
    IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
> quit

# mysql roundcubemail < SQL/mysql.initial.sql

Note 1: 'password' is the master password for the roundcube user. It is strongly
recommended you replace this with a more secure password. Please keep in
mind: You need to specify this password later in 'config/db.inc.php'.


* SQLite
--------
You need sqlite 2 (preferably 2.8) to setup the sqlite db 
(sqlite 3.x also doesn't work at the moment). Here is
an example how you can setup the sqlite.db for roundcube:

# sqlite -init SQL/sqlite.initial.sql sqlite.db
Loading resources from SQL/sqlite.initial.sql
SQLite version 2.8.16
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> .exit
# chmod o+rw sqlite.db

Make sure your configuration points to the sqlite.db file and that the
webserver can write to the file and the directory containing the file.


* PostgreSQL
------------
To use Roundcube with PostgreSQL support you have to follow these
simple steps, which have to be done as the postgres system user (or
which ever is the database superuser):

$ createuser roundcube
$ createdb -O roundcube -E UNICODE roundcubemail
$ psql roundcubemail

roundcubemail =# ALTER USER roundcube WITH PASSWORD 'the_new_password';
roundcubemail =# \c - roundcube
roundcubemail => \i SQL/postgres.initial.sql

All this has been tested with PostgreSQL 8.x and 7.4.x. Older
versions don't have a -O option for the createdb, so if you are
using that version you'll have to change ownership of the DB later.


Database cleaning
-----------------
Do keep your database slick and clean we recommend to periodically execute
bin/cleandb.sh which finally removes all records that are marked as deleted.
Best solution is to install a cronjob running this script daily.



MANUAL CONFIGURATION
====================

First of all, rename the files config/*.inc.php.dist to config/*.inc.php.
You can then change these files according to your environment and your needs.
Details about the config parameters can be found in the config files.
See http://trac.roundcube.net/wiki/Howto_Install for even more guidance.

You can also modify the default .htaccess file. This is necessary to
increase the allowed size of file attachments, for example:
	php_value       upload_max_filesize     2M


UPGRADING
=========

If you already have a previous version of Roundcube installed,
please refer to the instructions in UPGRADING guide.


OPTIMISING
==========

There are two forms of optimisation here, compression and caching, both aimed
at increasing an end user's experience using Roundcube Webmail. Compression
allows the static web pages to be delivered with less bandwidth. The index.php
of Roundcube Webmail already enables compression on its output. The settings
below allow compression to occur for all static files. Caching sets HTTP 
response headers that enable a user's web client to understand what is static
and how to cache it.

The caching directives used are:
 * Etags - sets at tag so the client can request is the page has changed
 * Cache-control - defines the age of the page and that the page is 'public'
   This enables clients to cache javascript files that don't have private 
   information between sessions even if using HTTPS. It also allows proxies
   to share the same cached page between users.
 * Expires - provides another hint to increase the lifetime of static pages.

For more information refer to RFC 2616.

Side effects:
-------------
These directives are designed for production use. If you are using this in
a development environment you may get horribly confused if your webclient
is caching stuff that you changed on the server. Disabling the expires 
parts below should save you some grief.

If you are changing the skins, it is recommended that you copy content to 
a different directory apart from 'default'.

Apache:
-------
To enable these features in apache the following modules need to be enabled:
 * mod_deflate
 * mod_expires
 * mod_headers

The optimisation is already included in the .htaccess file in the top 
directory of your installation.

If you are using Apache version 2.2.9 and later, in the .htaccess file
change the 'append' word to 'merge' for a more correct response. Keeping
as 'append' shouldn't cause any problems though changing to merge will 
eliminate the possibility of duplicate 'public' headers in Cache-control.

Lighttpd:
---------
With Lightty the addition of Expire: tags by mod_expire is incompatible with
the addition of "Cache-control: public". Using Cache-control 'public' is 
used below as it is assumed to give a better caching result.

Enable modules in server.modules:
    "mod_setenv"
    "mod_compress"

Mod_compress is a server side cache of compressed files to improve its performance.

$HTTP["host"] == "www.example.com" {

    static-file.etags = "enable"
    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Etag.use-mtimeDetails
    etag.use-mtime = "enable"

    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs:ModSetEnv
    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/roundcubemail/(plugins|skins|program)" {
        setenv.add-response-header  = ( "Cache-Control" => "public, max-age=2592000")
    }

    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs:ModCompress
    # set compress.cache-dir to somewhere outside the docroot.
    compress.cache-dir   = var.statedir + "/cache/compress"

    compress.filetype = ("text/plain", "text/html", "text/javascript", "text/css", "text/xml", "image/gif", "image/png")
}
